		<h3>SS18 Trend Report: All the trends you'll be wearing in 2018</h3>			
		<p>
				The Fashion Month dust has settled, we’ve finally emptied out our cases from Paris Fashion Week (still can’t find that missing earring, dammit) and the street stylers are back to Kira Kira-ing their breakfasts, instead of each other outside show venues.  We’ve done our Spring Summer 2018 fashion trends research, and now we’d say it’s high time for some next-season wardrobe plotting. Let’s face it, it’s never too early to start that wish-list – especially if you want more than a hope in hell of getting your hands on that Gucci bum bag. So, what did we learn from the NY/London/Milan/Paris Fashion Week whirl?

				We’ve got two words – Fashion Prozac. That’s right, after an epically depressing year for politics (and just about everything else), designers reacted in the only way they know how. With uplifting, colourful, joyous clothes that took us off into another universe. Kaleidescopes of rainbow colour, the yummy new sugared almond pastels, Versace’s Insta-breaking supermodel reunion, some pretty powerful 80s power dressing – and OTT texture and fringing galore. The message: the outlook might be a little gloomy right now, but at least we can dress ourselves happy. </p>

		<h3>Breakfast: Eating Healthy On The Run</h3>
		<img src="Healthyonthego.jpg" width="700px">
		<p>
			For many of us, breakfast is something quick we grab as we're running out the door, or maybe even a meal we skip completely. It's easy to grab a packaged bar from the cupboard when we're in a rush, or think we'll make up for it at lunch. But oftentimes, packaged foods have added sugars and unhealthy fats, and won't keep you full and energized until lunch. Here are some homemade breakfast options that are better for you, and easy to make.
			<ul>

			<li>Take muffins, for example. Instead of buying muffins at the coffee shop or grocery store (which can be jumbo-sized with little nutritional value) you can make your own muffins with healthy ingredients like fruit, nuts and whole wheat flour. Make them on a weekend and freeze them. Put one in your bag and it will be thawed and ready to eat by the time you get to work or school.</li>
 
			<li>Instant oatmeal is a great option that's a quick whole grain and will keep you full. Buy packets at the store and make them at work using hot water 	from the coffee maker. Just be sure to compare labels and pick flavors low in added sugars.</li>
 
			<li>Try a homemade smoothie. Smoothies are a great way to increase your fruit intake, and they're easy to make. A basic smoothie is just frozen fruit, low-fat milk or yogurt and 100% fruit juice, processed together in a blender until smooth. Experiment with different fruits to find out what you like. You can even add fresh vegetables to the mix!</li>

		<h3>A relationship expert shares the trick to getting your way in any situation</h3>
		<p>
			The key to winning an argument is to not start one at all.

			In 2004, amidst George Bush and John Kerry's heated US presidential election campaign, an Emory University professor of psychology and psychiatry named Drew Westen took MRI pictures of people's brains as they watched video footage of their favorite candidates contradicting themselves.

			The experiment, which Westen wrote about in his book "The Political Brain," showed that, when people begin to feel their worldview is under attack, the parts of their brains that handle reason and logic go to sleep, while the parts of their brain responsible for our fight-or-flight response light up. (Eric Barker goes into more detail about this research in this article.)

			As Harvard Business School lecturers John Neffinger and Matthew Kohutobserve observe in their book, "Compelling People: The Hidden Qualities That Make Us Influential," when a discussion becomes an argument, it's no longer an exercise in logic and reasoning. "If you're trying to win over someone whose natural allegiance are not with you, getting into an argument is a sure way to fail," they write.

			So how do you get your point across without ever inflaming someone's natural defenses?

			Dr. Michael McNulty, a master trainer from the Gottman Institute and founder of the Chicago Relationship Center, tells Business Insider the key is to use what psychologist and couples counselor John Gottman calls a "gentle start-up."

			Gottman spent 40 years researching exactly what goes into healthy relationships, and he posited in his book, "The Relationship Cure," that the same principles that make marriages work also hold true for many other kinds of relationships.

			To use the "gentle start-up" technique, McNulty explains that, when you want to express a complaint or concern to a partner or colleague, you should do so in a positive manner, avoid blaming language, use mostly "I" statements, and discuss your perspective, feelings, and needs.

			This template is a good example of how you would phrase a concern: "When X happens or happened, I feel Y and I need Z."

			Here's how you might ask for a raise using the "gentle start-up" technique:

			"When I look at my credentials and how hard I am working and compare my salary to others in my field...

				"I feel worried about my family's financial future. 
				"I feel kind of sad, because I want to stay here. 
				"I like the people and the company. 
				"I do not feel like my contributions are seen or understood.
				"I feel resentful.

				"I need my salary to be reviewed.
				"I need a higher salary.
				"I need the opportunity for bonuses or profit sharing."

			"This technique is so helpful in relationships of all kinds," McNulty says. "It helps to guard against the tendency that people feel to justify their feelings and needs so much so that they come off as critical or blaming to the other person before they are able to express what they feel and ask for what they want."

			The opposite of this technique is what's called a "harsh startup," which almost never works. "If partners start a conversation in a negative manner, 97% of the time that conversation will end negatively," McNulty says.
