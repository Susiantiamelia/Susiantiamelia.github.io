			    The Fashion Month dust has settled, we've finally emptied out our cases from Paris Fashion Week (still can't find that missing earring, dammit) and the street stylers are back to Kira Kira-ing their breakfasts, instead of each other outside show venues.  We've done our Spring Summer 2018 fashion trends research, and now we'd say it's high time for some next-season wardrobe plotting. Let's face it, it's never too early to start that wish-list – especially if you want more than a hope in hell of getting your hands on that Gucci bum bag. So, what did we learn from the NY/London/Milan/Paris Fashion Week whirl?


			    We've got two words – Fashion Prozac. That's right, after an epically depressing year for politics (and just about everything else), designers reacted in the only way they know how. With uplifting, colourful, joyous clothes that took us off into another universe. Kaleidescopes of rainbow colour, the yummy new sugared almond pastels, Versace's Insta-breaking supermodel reunion, some pretty powerful 80s power dressing – and OTT texture and fringing galore. The message: the outlook might be a little gloomy right now, but at least we can dress ourselves happy. 

			    Designers raided the Pantone colour chart for pulsating primary colours – tomato red made a strong showing, seen everywhere from Preen to Victoria Beckham. There's cobalt, emerald green and bright yellow. See Balenciaga's head to toe take – canary yellow dress, layered over a long-sleeved top in the same shade, and accessorised with matching platform Balenciaga Crocs – taking the prize for coolest/craziest collab of the season.
